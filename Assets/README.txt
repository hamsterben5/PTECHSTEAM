---------COMMIT #16----------------
If you're wondering why the project folder just exploded in size and why the latest commit is so large, it's because I added lots of HD Textures for walls, ground, trees, and prefabs for objects to put in the maze/world.
They're all not necessary, but recommended. Feel free to commit a deletion for ones you don't think we need.
**not like it matters with the BOCES internet speed of 3gb/s lol xd**

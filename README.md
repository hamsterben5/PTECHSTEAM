#### Class repository, codenamed PTECHSTEAM.
# The Computer Science STEAM Project For PTECH, 2016 - 2017
## Info
Mr. Tolan's class, AKA us, all the contributors, are assigned by Mr. Sheehan to create a game or otherwise fun activity to entertain 3rd to 8th graders, in hopes of them understanding what our program is and what we like about it, which could influence future classes by people interested in signing up. 
### Our current project
For right now, we're testing AI, animation, textures, wind, and other things important for a game to run. I expect we begin work on the prototype _three school days from now, which should be **February 8th, 2017.**_
## Current, up to date news on our project--  (I'll manage this for now.)

Currently a test scene, we will construct a 3D Maze with physics, multiple levels, a main menu, scoreboard/leaderboard, power ups, difficulty, chasing AI, etc.
Don't expect much here just yet.
Latest commit: Added wind turbulence and moving trees with LOD Billboards.

#### Tasks:

- [ ] Stop AI from stopping at walls when player is too far away or directly across a wall. @ZachSarvey
- [ ] Create main menu
- [ ] Figure out how to create multiple levels/scenes and link them to buttons on the main menu.
- [ ] AI model
- [ ] Background music and sound effects.
- [ ] SkyBox
- [ ] ~~Beat me in a game of MTG~~
- [ ] Get everyone on GitHub and Slack.
- [ ] Have everyone download the Slack client on their computers so we're all on, always.
- [ ] Create terrain THAT ISN'T FLAT?!
- [ ] Player sprint
- [ ] Stamina bar
- [ ] Fear/Sanity bar that increases when you look at AI, end game when full
- [ ] Organize a schedule of when people edit the Scene.unity, because frankly if more than one person changes it everything screws up.
- [x] Finish making this Task section.

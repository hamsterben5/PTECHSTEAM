#### Class repository, codenamed PTECHSTEAM.
# The Computer Science STEAM Project For PTECH, 2016 - 2017
## Info
Mr. Tolan's class, AKA us, all the contributors, are assigned by Mr. Sheehan to create a game or otherwise fun activity to entertain 3rd to 8th graders, in hopes of them understanding what our program is and what we like about it, which could influence future classes by people interested in signing up. 
### Our current project
For right now, we're testing AI, animation, textures, wind, and other things important for a game to run. I expect we begin work on the prototype _three school days from now, which should be **February 8th, 2017.**_
## Current, up to date news on our project--  (I'll manage this for now.)

Currently a test scene, we will construct a 3D Maze with physics, multiple levels, a main menu, scoreboard/leaderboard, power ups, difficulty, chasing AI, etc.
Don't expect much here just yet.
Latest commit: Added music and finished first maze.
